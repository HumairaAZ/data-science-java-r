# Data Science Project Using Java and R

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Java and R for a data science task. It reads a dataset, processes it in Java, and uses R for statistical analysis and visualization.

## Setup Instructions

1. Place your input data in the `data/input` directory.
2. Run the application using GitHub Actions.

## CI Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

## Expected Results

The input data is processed and visualized by the R script. The output is saved as `results.png` in the `data/output` directory.
